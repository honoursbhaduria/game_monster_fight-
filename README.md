Here’s a **tiny lore** about "Flogidoma" to give it that epic, ancient vibe for your game:

---

### **Legend of Flogidoma** 🌌🔥

In the forgotten corners of the world, where the mountains touch the heavens and the rivers glow with stardust, lies the **Flogidoma** — an ancient realm of fire, forged in the heart of a dying star. It is said that only the bravest souls dare to enter its scorching gates, where the winds are charged with the power of dragons, and the ground is bathed in molten light.

The **Flogidoma Sword**, a legendary weapon of unfathomable strength, is rumored to be hidden within the heart of this land. It was once wielded by the **Godfather Dragon**, a creature of myth, whose reign over the fires of the world was only rivaled by the gods themselves.

Only the chosen can uncover its secrets and wield the sword’s immense power — but those who seek it must face the dragons, overcome the trials of flame, and defeat the mighty **Godfather Dragon** in the ultimate battle for supremacy. Will you be the hero to wield the Flogidoma Sword and save the world? Or will you fall, like so many before you, to the fires of legend?

## 🎬 Storyline

In a broken kingdom ruled by monsters and fear,  
you — a clueless villager with nothing but a **stick** and a **pocketful of dreams** —  
must rise, fight, and **challenge fate itself**.

From slimes to fanged beasts to the legendary **Godfather Dragon**,  
the path is brutal, gold is scarce, and your **weapons are hilariously bad**...  
at first.

But hidden deep within the madness, lies a secret:  
an **Easter Egg** that could turn the tides.  
**2000 gold**... or the mythical **Super Sword**.  
Your luck, your destiny.

Will you **become a legend**?  
Or just another snack for the beasts? 🦴
